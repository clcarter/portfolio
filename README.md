This repo is collection of personal work intenteded to showcase my programming skills.

The Finance folder contains the code for a project I worked on as part of a homework assignment.
The Flexigrid code and Spryassets are not mine, though I did make adjustments to the code to make them suit the functionality of this app.
this project uses ajax calls inside a js created table to update the database after the field being edited loses focus. This has the benefit of saving
changes instantaniously without requiring the user to manually save info, though it does put greater strain on the server. Instead of a chunks of data
saving in a few requests, small bits of data are saved in almost continuous calls to the server.

The plsc folder is a website I designed for use by myself and my Political Science Group as a collaboration of notes and Stata commands. Though it was under-
utilized, the project was a great learning tool for me as I worked with an XML document to provide formatting for the Sata Commands. I used a lot of prebuilt
code in this project to expidite its creation and I completed the site within one weekend.

Most of my other work has been for BYU Chinese Flagship and I do not have the right to upload the code to those sites. However, here are the links to those sites.
They are being managed by another party now and may reflect work done by other individuals.

http://chineseflagship.byu.edu/cfc-beta -- beta drupal site that I customized from a template. Most of the front end design is my own.
http://overseaschineseflagship.org -- other than content updates this site is completely my work.
http://utah.clt7-12.org/ -- I created this site as a resource site for Utah Chinese Teachers. Unfortunately I was unable to complete the website before I had to quit the job (it was a student position and I was graduating).
