<br>
I hope this website proves helpful in completing our homework and studying for the tests. If everyone from the group sends me notes, I think it will end up being very effective. If you have any ideas about how to make this website better, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:t0f3rchr15@gmail.com">t0f3rchr15@gmail.com</a> and I will try to implement your suggestions.<br>
